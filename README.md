Logical Signals is a game where you have to direct and change signals with logical gates to meet the end result.

# How to play:
- You can move gates by dragging their buttons (not the plus ones)
- To create connections, click on the + buttons (left for input, right for output)
- To remove connections, right click the connnection line
- On levels, a node has to have 2 inputs(Except the OUTPUT and NOT node), but only 1 output
- On DIY mode, a node can have more than 2 inputs, except for OUTPUT and NOT
- You can change an INPUT's gate value by clicking on it
- You have to connect the nodes in a way to meet the required result
                                                     
# Logical Gates explanation:
- AND: Returns 1 if all inputs are 1, otherwise 0
- OR: Returns 1 if any inputs are 1, otherwise 0
- NAND: Returns 1 if any inputs are 0, otherwise 0
- NOR: Returns 1 if all inputs are 0, otherwise 0
- XOR: Returns 1 if atleast 1 input is different, otherwise 0
- XNOR: Returns 1 if all inputs are the same, otherwise 0
